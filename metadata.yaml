description: In a distant future, humans have overtaken much of the universe and have
  banished their enemies to the far corners of their territory. A planet long thought
  to be uninhabited is suspected of being a hub for rebel activities. Will the small
  police force be able to circumvent a potentially disastrous conflict?
